# Making this website

This is the first article of my website, which explains how I made this website.

The motivations for this website are:

- To have somewhere to share my work experience and portfolio.
- To share any technical findings or explorations I have in case they may be useful to others.
- To experiment and have fun.

# Pre-Requisites

This post assumes some familiarity with the `npm` ecosystem and `ReactJS`.

## pnpm

I used [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) for this project, but you could just as well use other package managers such as `npm` or `yarn`.

## TypeScript

This project uses [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

## create-next-app

This project uses the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, configured to use TypeScript.

# Setting up the project

## twin.macro config

I have enjoyed using [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) as a means of implementing [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes while using CSS-in-JS components. For example, a component can quickly be defined using the `tw` helper:

```js
const StyledColumnDiv = tw.div`
  flex
  flex-column
  items-center
`;
```

If `twin.macro` is not flexible enough, it is easy to fallback to `styled-components` and even have interoperability between the libraries.

```js
const StyledModalDiv =
  styled.div <
  {$isVisible: boolean} >
  `
  hidden
  ${({$isVisible}) => $isVisible && tw`block`}
`;
```

Some links which may be useful in getting `twin.macro` setup for a NextJS project:

- https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples/tree/master/next-styled-components
- twin.d.ts to import styles directly from `twin.macro`
- [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense and Twin](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro/discussions/227)

## eslint

I use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and flagging code errors. The below are the modules I use for my eslint setup:

- `eslint`
- `eslint-config-next`
- `@next/eslint-plugin-next`
- `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`
- `@typescript-eslint/parser`

For more details my eslint setup you could take a look at `.eslintrc.json`.

## prettier

I use [prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. By leaning into prettier to auto-format my code, I can spend less time thinking about code style and more time on my actual implementation. The below are the modules I use for my prettier setup:

- `prettier`
- `eslint-config-prettier`
- `eslint-plugin-prettier`
- `@trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports`

My prettier config can be found in `prettier.config.js`

## MDX

I have introduced [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to allow content to be quickly drafted while still having the flexibility to use React components.

_**This page**_ is written in MDX!

## Typography

Styles are reset by the inclusion of Tailwind in the project. To unreset the style of our MDX content I have introduced [@tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) which provides the `prose` class.

## Highlighting code blocks

To highlight code blocks I have added [remark-prism](https://github.com/sergioramos/remark-prism), which uses [Prism](https://prismjs.com/) to provide syntax highlighting.

I am using the [Dracula](https://draculatheme.com/prism) theme to add color to these code blocks.

## Deploying

I use [namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) as my domain name registrar. This domain costs me ~$5 a year.

I deploy this project to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) using their free tier.

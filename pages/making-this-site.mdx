# Making greglinscheid.com

This is the first article of my website, which explains how I made this website.

The motivations for this website are:

- To have somewhere to share my work experience and portfolio.
- To share any technical findings or explorations I have in case they may be useful to others.
- To experiment and have fun.

# Pre-Requisites

This article assumes a reasonable experience with the `npm` ecosystem `ReactJS`.

## pnpm

I used `pnpm` for this project, but you could just as well use other package managers such as `npm` or `yarn`. A nice thing about `pnpm` is that it uses hard linking and symbolic linking to manage its `node_modules`, which can lead to less disk bloat and boosted installation speeds. I recommend doing research on the benefits of these different package managers, as they are all viable but have their own trade-offs.

You can install `pnpm` using `npm` with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Alternative means of installing `pnpm` [can be found here](https://pnpm.io/installation).
